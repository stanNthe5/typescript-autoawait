# TypeScript Autoawait 

[This VScode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=StanNthe5.typescript-autoawait) automatically add 'await' keyword when you autocomplete a function name, add missing 'async' keyword to the context function.

## Alert

This plugin is not intended for beginners. Itâ€™s simply a helper to reduce some repetitive work. You should have a solid understanding of how asynchronous behavior works in JavaScript before considering using it.

## What if I want a Promise

Now you have to manually type full function name to avoid autoComplete to be trigered. Or manually remove the 'await' after added. If you have any idea on this, submit a post on the Discussion tab.
